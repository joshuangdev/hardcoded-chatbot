# Hardcoded Chatbot

A simple Python chatbot that responds to user input using hardcoded rules and keywords.

## Features

- Responds to greetings, farewells, and common questions.
- Provides some fun and custom responses.
- Handles unknown inputs with random fallback replies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Bot

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run:

    ```
    python [app.py](http://_vscodecontentref_/0)
    ```

## Files
