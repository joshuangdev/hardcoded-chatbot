# Hardcoded Chatbot

A simple Python chatbot that responds to user input using hardcoded rules and keywords.

## Features

- Responds to greetings, farewells, and common questions.
- Provides some fun and custom responses.
- Handles unknown inputs with random fallback replies.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Running the Bot

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run:

    ```
    python app.py
    ```

4. Type your messages and chat with the bot!

## Files

- `app.py` - Main chatbot logic and user interaction loop.
